## Introduction

**Reliverse CLI** is your all-in-one command-line companion for _setting up_ and _enhancing_ web projects. Starting fresh or upgrading an existing app? This tool helps you:

- **Effortlessly create projects**: Spin up new web apps or import existing templates in a flash.  
- **Apply powerful codemods**: Safely refactor code and integrate popular libraries.  
- **Automate configuration**: Set up ESLint, Prettier, Biome, `.env` files, Git hooks, and more.  
- **Support multiple frameworks**: Enjoy seamless compatibility with Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, and beyond.  
- **Customize with templates**: Clone pre-built templates and merge them conflict-free.  
- **Automate GitHub & deployments**: Quickly create repositories, push commits, and deploy to Vercel.  
- **Extend functionality**: Upcoming Reliverse Addons enable even more features and integrations.

Although it‚Äôs built primarily for JavaScript/TypeScript (especially React and Next.js), @reliverse/cli is flexible enough to grow beyond web development, streamlining workflows with a single, powerful CLI.
