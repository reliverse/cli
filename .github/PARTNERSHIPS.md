# 🤝 Partnerships

Starting with version 1.2.6, Relivator is now truly production-ready. However, there's still much to be accomplished, and you might be surprised when you check the [✅ Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) section! To reach our goals, we are seeking partners to collaborate and support each other's projects' growth. If you're interested and would like to learn more, please feel free to email me at <blefnk@gmail.com>.
