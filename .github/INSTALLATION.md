# Installation

<!-- [![Bootstrap Relivator with a stack of your choice using the Reliverse CLI](https://github.com/blefnk/reliverse-website-builder)] -->

**How to Install and Get Started:** You have two options for installation. You can either immediately deploy to Vercel using the button below and start working on the generated repository right away (but still read the information below), or you can follow the short or detailed manual installation instructions provided.

**By The Way:** *Sometimes, we gift `Reliverse Pro`, which gives you early access to the Reliverse projects ecosystem, including Relivator, as well as upcoming plugins, to randomly selected individuals. We also give away other interesting things. Simply `star this repository` and [let us know how to reach you](https://forms.gle/NXZ6QHpwrxh52VA36). To join the discussion, hop into [the project's Discord](https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ).*

## One-click Installation Method (**find recommended method below**)

**🔥 Important Note:** Relivator currently requires specifying Clerk environment variable keys, as its API has changed. We are working on making Clerk optional again. However, all other environment variables are optional. If this statement is incorrect and something is broken, please let us know.

By using this method, you will get only the front-end, with all the functionality disabled (learn how to enable it by reading the manual instructions below):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fblefnk%2Frelivator-nextjs-template&project-name=relivator&repository-name=my-new-repository-name)

**Please note:** As of version 1.2.6 and 1.3.0 (dev and canary), it is recommended to use Clerk as the authProvider (specified in the `reliverse.config.ts` file) since this version has been more thoroughly tested with Clerk. We are working on fixing and improving the stability of Auth.js (next-auth@beta/NextAuth.js) as an authentication provider.

> I'm ([blefnk](https://github.com/blefnk)) working to automate the Relivator's installation process as much as possible. The upcoming version 1.3.0 will feature a significant automated installation. If you wish to try the alpha version of one of my many automation scripts, use the `bun deps:install` (or `bun deps:install-all`) command. However, before running this script, you should manually install the essentials (edit 'bunx jsr' if needed): `npx nypm add typescript tsx @clack/prompts @mnrendra/read-package nypm ora fs-extra pathe fast-npm-meta semver @types/semver redrun && bunx jsr add @reliverse/core`.

**Please note**: As of version 1.2.6 and 1.3.0 (dev and canary), it is recommended to use Clerk as the authProvider (specified in the `reliverse.config.ts` file) since this version has been more thoroughly tested with Clerk. We are working on fixing and improving the stability of Auth.js (next-auth@beta/NextAuth.js) as an authentication provider.

1. **Node.js LTS**: Ensure you have *Node.js LTS* installed using: **(a)** classical method - [Windows/macOS](https://nodejs.org) | [Linux](https://youtu.be/NS3aTgKztis); **(b)** nvm - [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#install-nvm-windows) | [macOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating); **(c)** [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#readme).
2. **Essential Tools**: Then, run `corepack enable pnpm` to install [*pnpm*](https://pnpm.io/installation). Also, install [*VSCode*](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/git/install-and-set-up-git), *GitHub Desktop* ([Windows/macOS](https://desktop.github.com) | [Linux](https://dev.to/rahedmir/is-github-desktop-available-for-gnu-linux-4a69)), and [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli). If you're a Windows user: install [PowerShell 7.4+](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package) as well.
3. **Project Cloning**: [*Fork the repository*](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator-nextjs-template/fork) or click on the `Use this template` button. Use GitHub Desktop to download it to your device. The project size is about 12MB, but ensure you have at least 7GB of disk space for comfortable work, as the `node_modules` and `.next` folders require it.
4. **Configuration**: Open the project folder in VSCode. Install the recommended extensions from [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) and/or install the advanced VSCode configurations by using `bun reli:vscode` (choose the `default` preset for the best experience or the `ultimate` preset for the best experience). You can also refer to the [⚙️ Scripts](./SCRIPTS.md) and [🤔 FAQ](./FAQ.md) *RQ19* below to learn more about this script and its configurations. You can press `Cmd/Ctrl+F` and search for "`Q19`/`Q20`" if you want to install more extensions and settings (remember, more extensions mean slower VSCode). Then click `File > Exit` (VSCode will save all your open windows). Open VSCode again. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or just `F1`) and search for `>Create New Terminal`, or just press **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+~** *(on Windows make sure that it uses PowerShell 7.4+, click the arrow next to + ➞ Select Default Profile ➞ PowerShell)*. If VSCode prompts you to allow the usage of the project's TypeScript version, allow it if you're a Windows user. On other operating systems, you may or may not encounter path issues.
5. **Environment**: Run `bun install` (or `npx nypm install`) and/or, optionally, `install:global` to install the required packages. It is also recommended to configure `reliverse.config.ts` file. Then, optionally, you can use `bun deps:install-all`—especially `bun deps:install-all` (*this is currently an alpha script*)—to unlock some additional features, like the `eslint.config.ultimate.ts` preset (which will have a `.txt` extension by default starting with Relivator v1.3.0). (NOTE: As of Relivator v1.2.6, the `ultimate` preset is configured by default, so no action is required). Next, configure Relivator to meet your needs using the `bun reli:setup` and/or `bun reli:vscode` commands, and relaunch VSCode. You have two options: deploy with zero values in the `.env` file (resulting in just the frontend without features related to auth, database, pricing, etc.), or copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file and fill in the values you want (everything is optional starting with Relivator v1.2.6). It is highly recommended to fill in the `DATABASE_URL` field. Then, set the database provider in `drizzle.config.ts` and make changes in related files if needed. Finally, send the database schema to the database using `bun db:push`. You can learn more about databases below in the current `README.md` file.
6. **Run, Stop, Build**: Run the app with `bun run dev` or `bun turbo:dev` (interactive but unstable). Visit <http://localhost:3000> to check it out. Stop it by focusing on the console and pressing `Ctrl+C`. After making changes, build the app using `bun run build` or `bun turbo:build`. *Don't worry if you see warnings related to Clerk, React Compiler, Babel, next-auth, etc. when running the build; these are known issues not related to Relivator.* Note that when using the bun [turbo:build](https://turbo.build) command, the VSCode terminal may not exit automatically. If this happens, press Cmd/Ctrl+C to close the process manually.
7. **Check, Commit, Deploy**: To check if the current codebase meets [@reliverse/standard](https://github.com/reliverse/standard), run `bun appts` (or `bun appts:noputout`, or `bun turbo:appts`, or `bun appts:nobuild`). Learn more about project scripts in the next section. If everything is fine, upload the project to your GitHub profile using GitHub Desktop. Finally, deploy it by importing the project into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new), making the website publicly accessible on the internet. Alternatively, you can use `bun deploy` or just `vercel` to preview and inspect the local deployment without committing to GitHub every time.

**It is recommended:** From time to time, run `bun reli:prepare`. This script executes `bun install`, which checks for issues or installs/removes manually added/removed dependencies in your `package.json` file. It also executes `bun latest`, which installs the latest versions of project dependencies. Finally, it runs `bun appts`, which will do its best to improve your code and check for any errors. **Note:** Since `bun latest` updates all packages to their latest versions, be aware that something in the code might break, especially if considerable time has passed since the last version of Relivator was released. Therefore, you can use, for example, the VSCode extension `Open Multiple Files` to easily find and fix broken code, or reach out to the [Relivator Discord server](https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ) for assistance, or create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator-nextjs-template/issues). You can learn more about those scripts and the mentioned extension below in the current `README.md` file.

**If you'd like** to share your work, get/provide feedback, or ask for help, feel free to do so either [in our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ) or [via GitHub discussions](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator-nextjs-template/discussions). **Note:** Currently, the instructions above may be outdated. Please contact us if something goes wrong; everything will be updated in Relivator 1.3.0.
