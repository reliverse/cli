## 🖥️ Hire Me

Hello, I'm [Nazar Kornienko](https://github.com/blefnk), a flexible web developer specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript and React/Next.js front-end development. If you’re looking for someone with my skill set, please contact me at <blefnk@gmail.com> or via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/611578864958832641).

Please explore the current repository to learn more about my experience with the JavaScript/TypeScript and React/Next.js ecosystems. I'm available for both remote work and full-time positions. While my primary focus is frontend and CLI development, if you need help with code automation tools, small tasks related to Python or backend, or even designs in Figma, graphic design, or copywriting/marketing, feel free to reach out to me as well—I’d love to see how I can assist.

## 🙏 Dear Audience, I Need Your Help

Currently, I’m in a challenging financial situation, so I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or mentions of my work and Relivator as part of my portfolio, such as on the pages of your own repositories. Your support would mean a lot to me! As a token of my appreciation, I’d be happy to send some interesting gifts to you. Thank you for your time and consideration!

## 🎶 Recommendation

> Coding becomes a whole new experience with the right music, doesn't it? Enhance your workflow with Relivator and enjoy the soothing melodies from the [MF Piano YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@mfpiano). This channel, run by my brother, offers beautiful piano covers that are perfect for background music. Your subscriptions, views, likes, and comments would mean the world to us and help his channel grow. Thank you for your support!
